<h1>About</h1>

There is a steady stream of fantastic events for digital professionals forever occurring across the globe. TechConf.Directory's goal is to aid your discovery of such conferences.

With a [fully open API](/api) providing comprehensive data for your needs, this is not just a site but also the database for whatever you may choose to build.

TechConf.Directory came about because I found it difficult to not only find conferences but also to easily find information about each conference in one place.

It is invaluable to be able to access details on a huge number of conferences and then both filter and sort through them. It allows planning of trips to attend multiple conferences consecutively and the opportunity to stumble across events you might otherwise remain unaware of.
